It introduces physics through \na set of modules that are closely connected to our everyday life and future.  \n \nThis course is only available online via Brightspace.  \n \nPlease note that Faculty of Science students may only take this course as a free elective. \n  \nCOURSE LEVEL LEARNING OUTCOMES \nBy the end of the course, students should be able to: \n1. Explain physics related phenomenon using basic physics principles and terminology \n2. Perform basic calculation/estimations to solve simple physics related problems \n3. Make correct judgement/decisions on physics related issues in their daily life based on basic physics \nprinciples \n \n \n \n \nPHYS 2903 \nPHYSICS TOWARDS THE FUTURE \nAn on-line course based on the   \nOpen Physics Education Module  \n \n \nInstructor: Razieh Enjilela \nEmail: Razieh.Enjilela@carleton.ca \nOffice Hours:  Tuesday and Thursday \n                      11:30 p.m.- 12:30 p.m.  \n \n\n \n \nP a g e | 2 \nTEXTBOOK \nThe optional text-book for the course is “Physics Beyond the Comfort Zone” by Peter Watson.  This \ntextbook has a number of relevant sections relating to material for this course but does not cover \nsome areas.  The lectures and supplementary materials are intended to cover the course with this \ntextbook as a useful but optional additional aid. This is an e-text book available from Amazon or \nIBooks for $9.99. If you have any difficulties purchasing the textbook, please contact me.  \n \n \nCONTENT \nThe following thematic modules will be covered in this course. Each module will help you answer a series \nof questions listed below.  \n \n1. Sound and Music \nIn many ways, music might be viewed as one of the most human of inventions.  What is the nature \nof  sound  and  what  are  the  relationships  between  pitch, loudness,  musical  scales, and  the \nfundamental properties of sounds?  How are sounds generated, from different types of instruments, \nthat create a musical performance?   \n \n2. Light and Colour \nWhat is light exactly? What is radiation and electromagnetic waves? How do eyes and lenses \nwork? How do we see colours? How do we communicate with EM waves? \n \n3. Cell Phone \nIt has become commonplace, almost anywhere one travels in the world, to see people using cell \nphones for conversations, texting, accessing the internet, listening to music, and taking photos. \nWhat are the physics principles behind the manufacture and operation of cell phones?   \n \n4. The Solar System and Beyond \nThe nature of the universe beyond our planet has always fascinated humans.  How do we use \nrockets to place satellites in orbit and send missions out into the solar system?  What is the \nstructure of our solar system...of our galaxy...of the universe? \n \n5. Medical Physics \nMedical physics is about using physical approaches to diagnose and treat diseases. What is x-\nray? How does it “see” through our body? What is MRI? Why do doctors always order MRI instead \nof x-ray if you have a joint pain? How does ultrasound scan work?   \n \n6. Recent Advances \nSome of the most interesting questions in science are being tackled by physicists around the \nworld.  What are dark matter and dark energy?  What are gravitational waves?  Why is discovery \n\n \n \nP a g e | 3 \nof the Higgs particle important and what does it tell us?  What are neutrinos and how do we \nobserve them? \n \n \nMODULE COMPLETION DATES AND PHYSICS TOPICS \nCOVERED \nThematic Modules Expected \ncompletion dates \nof lecture videos \nPhysics topics Covered \n1.
